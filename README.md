# My-Crypto-Trading-Bot
This is a trading bot that I created to trade cryptos. It's not the best, and there is some junk code commented out. But I am putting alot of work into it to make it trade how I want it to. 

You will have to have a Robin Hood account for this bot to work.
It does use a GUI, but it has limited options. Most everything is still hard coded. Right now, it only does the slow day option becasue I am testing a new coin. 
This is my first Github project, so please contace me with any questions.
